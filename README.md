# Pokemon mahjong

## Motivation

There was pokemon mahjong game my close person loved to play. When tried to find any ways to play that game now, there was only this clone written on Adobe Flash platform. So i took it and adjusted so this game at least could be played outside of some strangely looking flash game website

## How to change

I used jpexs-decompiler to adjust some of game behaviour:

- more help and change amount
- almost infinity time

## TODO:

- [ ] add game restart button
- [ ] remove style button
- [ ] remove stage button
- [ ] maybe rewrite game
